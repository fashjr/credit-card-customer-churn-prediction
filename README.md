Predicting a customer will attrite or not:  building 8 models, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Light Gradient Boosting.

comparing all models and performing hyperparameter tuning using Randomized search crossvalidation

oversampling train data using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)

building and training the same 6 models as before, using the over-sampled training data for training the models.

comparing all models and performing hyperparameter tuning using Randomized search crossvalidation

Undersampling train data using Random Under Sampler

Building Models with Undersampled Data

Building Pipelines for productionizing the model
